Hooks to user defined process/file and searches it's memory (defined by user) based on user's value/choice. Writes to that same memory values defined by user in db/PLATFORM.hexdb (list of file names & title etc) and db/PLATFORM/PROFILE.hexcl

For the most part this is likely to be used as a PC version of ARMAX, Xploder etc.

We want to make it very clear that any problem created while using this software is **NOT** our responsibility, all actions the software takes against other software, hardware or data **REQUIRE** user initiation and therefore cannot harm the user's PC / Data by it's own will.
